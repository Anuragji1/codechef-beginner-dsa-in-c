Debugging Algorithm Problems: Flow of Control Introduction
Mastering debugging is crucial for any programmer, and understanding the flow of control lies at the heart of effectively diagnosing and resolving algorithm problems. This introduction aims to equip you with the essential knowledge to tackle those pesky bugs with confidence.

Flow of Control Basics:

The flow of control dictates the order in which statements are executed within your program. Common control flow constructs include:

Sequential execution: Statements are executed one after the other in the order they're written.
Conditional branching: if statements and loops control the execution path based on conditions.
Iteration: Loops like while and for allow repeated execution of a block of code.
Recursion: A function calling itself allows for complex nested execution.
Debugging Flow of Control Issues:

When your algorithm isn't performing as expected, analyzing the flow of control becomes essential. Here's how:

Identify the symptom: What is the incorrect behavior your program exhibits?
Trace the logic: Step through the code line by line, analyzing the values of variables and the conditions being evaluated.
Spot inconsistencies: Look for deviations from the intended execution path, such as unintended loops or jumps.
Utilize tools: Debuggers and print statements can be invaluable for visualizing the program's state at different points.
Common Flow of Control Bugs:

Here are some typical culprits for algorithm issues:

Logic errors: Misconceptions in the problem-solving approach leading to incorrect code.
Conditional mistakes: Incorrect conditions in if statements or loops causing improper branching.
Off-by-one errors: Looping the wrong number of times or accessing invalid array indices.
Missing base cases: Recursive functions without base cases can lead to infinite loops.
